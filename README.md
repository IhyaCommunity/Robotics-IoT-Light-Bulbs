# Robotics & IoT
## Control Light Blubs
Control Light Blubs using Raspberry Pi, Node.JS and Johnny-Five. This demo originally presented at the Robotics &amp; IoT Workshop.

### Follow these steps to run the project

1) Copy and paste this folder to Raspberry Pi using VNC Server (TigerVNC Viewer), or download the source code directly using Chromium web browser in Raspberry Pi.

2) If not already installed, install Node.JS in Raspberry Pi using the command below:

    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -`
    
    `sudo apt install -y nodejs`

3) In Raspberry Pi Terminal, move to the directory which contains these code files

    `cd <path to your directory>`
    e.g
    `cd /home/pi/Desktop/Robotics-IoT-Light-Blubs`


4) Install the required packages mentioned in `package.json` file using the command:

    `npm install`

5) Run the script

    `sudo $(which node) bulbs.js`


If everything works fine, it should create a folder named `node_modules` in the project directory.

Note: It is recommended to install node modules (packages) for each project separately in the project directory.

Good Luck! üëç
